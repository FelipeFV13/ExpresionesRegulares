Upon request, Customer  will furnish ABDC complete annual and quarterly financial statements and other evidence of its financial  condition necessary to establish, in ABDC's opinion, Customer's ability to perform its obligations. If ABDC  reasonably believes Customer's ability to make payments is impaired or its financial condition has  materially deteriorated, ABDC may from time to time amend Customer's payment terms, require past due  amounts to be paid and/or require posting of adequate security or such other documents as ABDC may  require.
